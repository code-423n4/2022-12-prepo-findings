Hello Team ,

All the below suggestions and observations are for the "https://github.com/prepo-io/prepo-monorepo/blob/feat/2022-12-prepo/apps/smart-contracts/core/contracts/WithdrawHook.sol " contract . Some of the suggestions and possible observations are below .


1. One potential issue with this code is that it is using a global variable to track the amount of collateral withdrawn in a given period. This global variable is shared among all users of the contract, which means that every time a user withdraws collateral, the entire global state of the contract must be updated. This can lead to high gas costs if the contract is used frequently.

    A possible solution to this problem would be to use a mapping from user address to the amount of collateral that has been withdrawn in the 
    current period. This way, only the state for a single user would need to be updated when a withdrawal is made, which would reduce gas costs.

2. Another potential issue with this code is that it is using a global variable to track the last time the global withdrawal period was reset. This means that every time a user makes a withdrawal, the contract must check the current block timestamp and compare it to the last reset timestamp to determine if a new period has started. This can also lead to high gas costs if the contract is used frequently.
